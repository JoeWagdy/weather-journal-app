# Installation

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working.

Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:
```
git init

git clone https://github.com/JoeWagdy/weather-journal-app.git
```
open the terminal in the project location and start the server using the command below:
``` 
node server.js
```


# Usage
